# Team JAM React Client

You can find the deployed project at [teamjam.netlify.com](https://teamjam.netlify.com/).

## Project Overview

JAMbda Treasure Hunt is a Multi-User Dungeon Role-Playing Game where players compete with one another to traverse an island maze, solve puzzles, unearth powerful artifacts, and more! The game is run as part of the computer science curriculum at Lambda School.

Players explore a 1000-room map seeking treasure, equipment, and information. Along the way, they visit shrines to grow their skills and abilities, acquire gear to enhance their strength and speed, engage in interdimensional travel, and eat a whole lot of donuts... all in pursuit of the elusive Golden Snitch!

Navigating JAMbda Treasure Hunt requires an understanding of a variety of topics in Computer Science, including Algorithms and Data Structures, Blockchain Technology, Graph Theory, and Computer Architecture.

This client includes most of the functionality in the game, aside from blockchain mining which was run locally. Pathfinding and decoding are powered by algorithms that run on a Heroku server. See [Backend Documentation](https://github.com/Team-JAM/back-end) for more details.
